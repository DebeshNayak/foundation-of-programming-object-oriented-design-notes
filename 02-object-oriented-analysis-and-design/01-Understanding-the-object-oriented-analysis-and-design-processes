Understanding the object oriented analysis and design:
Notes:
- Object-oriented programming allows you to organize complex data sets in a way that makes manipulating data
  more streamlined during coding.
- In large part, this is due to the use of classes and objects within data sets.
- Understanding object-oriented analysis and design processes helps you learn how
to identify classes and objects for use in your development projects.
----------------
The object-oriented design process:
? How to identify the classes.
There are 5 process to do this:
1. Gather "Requirements":
  - What the app need to do
  - What problem you trying to solve
  - Focuses and get specific and write it down
  - So that we can get the half pass idea that "What the app could do vs what the app going to do"

2. "Describe" the app
  - Describe the application in simple narative small self content pieces
    that how people going to use the app
  - Self contain pieces and there are some technique for this, using use cases and user storage.
  - That will contain smallest set of storage that will contain real application.
  - This may be still inaccurate or incomplete or may change but we have to proceed with the development
  - At this point we don't have the mock up or prototype of the user interface,
    sometime this is essential and sometime that is distraction

3. "Identify" the main objects
  - This is where we have to identify the actual classes.
  - We have to pick out the most important idea, most important concept, the most important things of our
    and discard what are irrelevant.
  - Not everything we will pick here will not become a class, but the lot of them will

4. Describe the "Interactions"
  - Ex: A customer will open a bank account
        A spaceship will explode when it touches a asteroid
  - This will let us better understand interaction between those objects
  - What they do and what order they need to do, and one way that is done is called sequence diagram

5. Create a "Class Diagram"
  - Visual representation of the class that you need.
  - Here we have to take care about object oriented principle like: APIE

So no coding yet.
The output could be on whiteboard, notebook, piece of paper or using some electronics tool.

- Result of these process is class diagram.
  - The classes that you need to make
  - The methods in those classes
  - Interaction between those object in the application.

- In iterative approach of software development, we need to revisit and refine these
  steps frequently during development cycle.
