What is abstraction?
Notes:
- Abstraction focuses on the essential properties of a thing instead of one specific example.
- If you think of a table, chances are that you give height and width to it, but don't consider exact dimensions.
- Likewise, in Object-Oriented programming, when you make a class for bank accounts, you don't make a class
  specifically for Joe's or Alice's account. Instead, you make a class that covers the
  accounts of a broad set of people.
