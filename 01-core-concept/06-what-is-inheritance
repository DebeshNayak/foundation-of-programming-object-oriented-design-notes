What is inheritance?
Notes:
- Programming quickly and effectively is all about reusing code and keeping it as clean as possible.
- Inheritance is one function that helps eliminate the need to create completely new class in OOP.
- What is inheritance? Think of inheritance in programming like making a clone.
- The new set will have everything the old set has, but with the option to add new information and function.

What is inheritance?
- Great form of code reuse.
- Like customer class can be inherited from person class
- Customer inherit from person
- So the customer class has all the attributes and behaviors of the person class
  without to write any code, only we have to add new attributes and behaviors of the customer class
- Here:
  Person Class: Super Class (Parent class)
  Customer Class: Sub-class (Child Class)
- We can inherit some other class from the person class with some new attribute and behaviors like "Employee"

* Language like C++ allow to inherit from more super class, and which is called multiple inheritance
* But it is much common to use single inheritance which is enforced in Java, C#, Ruby
