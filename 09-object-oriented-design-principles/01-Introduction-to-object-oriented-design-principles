Introduction to object-oriented design principles:
Notes:
- One of the big drawbacks of object-oriented design is that, unlike with most
  programming, you don't get crashes and error messages if your class architecture
  has structural flaws.
- This may seem like a benefit -- the application will still run -- but leaving
  these flaws in place makes code unnecessarily complicated and difficult to maintain.
---------------
- If we don't use inheritance or other object oriented principle the program works
  but hard to read / understand / maintain.
- So we have to follow popular OOP general principle which are guideline for
  better OOP design.
- These design principle are the things that should be iterate through class design.
