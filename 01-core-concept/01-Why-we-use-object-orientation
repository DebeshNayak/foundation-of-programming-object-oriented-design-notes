Why we use object orientation:
* Object-orientation provides a real-world programming solution to people working in the world of
  - web applications,
  - mobile apps, and
  - game development.
* It isn't a language, but rather a set of ideas that multiple languages support.
* Object-orientation is split into self-contained objects with their own logic and data,
  it is relatively simple to manage, plan, and execute. That's why we use object-orientation.
