What is encapsulation?
- Same as capsule, medicine capsule, food capsule
- Surrounding something - keep the contain together and protect them
- So in the case of classes and object taking the properties and behavior and
  bundling them together in a same unit or same class
- Restrict access to the inner working of that class/object (Data hiding)

Example: in the bank account class any other part of the application can't change
it's property like accountBalance directly, they have to use it's corresponding method
to change it's property.

- Black boxing (only expose what ever necessary to the outside world - think of landline telephone)
