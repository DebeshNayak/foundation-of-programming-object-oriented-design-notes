Using aggregation and composition:
Notes:
- Aggregation is when one object contains another object, such as how a car contains a
  steering wheel.
- In contrast, composition is a more specific form of aggregation.
- It indicates that one objects owns another object.
- We can use aggregation and composition to show relational and ownership information among classes.
-------------
* Aggregation describes a "HAS A" relationship
Ex:
  - A customer has a address.
  - A car has a engine.
  - A bank has many bank accounts.
  - A university has many students.
------------
In UML Aggregation:
- Aggregation has the symbol unfilled diamond symbol towards the owner object.

+-----------+               +-----------+
| Classroom |<>-------------| Student   |
+-----------+ 1            *+-----------+
              aggregation
  - Classroom has a students
-------------
* Composition is a more specific type of aggregation, and it implies ownership
+-----------+               +-----------+
| Document  |<>-------------| Page      |
+-----------+ 1         1..*+-----------+
                composition
              (implies ownership)
              
  - Document object composed of(made up of) page objects
  - We can call it "Document object has a page object"
  - When the document object deleted, all the associated page object deleted too.
- When the owning object destroyed so are the contained object.
- So in this case we need to write constructor and destructor to constructing and
  destroying internal objects.
