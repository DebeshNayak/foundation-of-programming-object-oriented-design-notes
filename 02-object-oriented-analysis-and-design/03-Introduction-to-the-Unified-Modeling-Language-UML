Note:
- Using graphic interpretations to map out applications can help during programming and development.
- If you already know what classes need what functions, you can dive right into the programming part.
- An introduction to the Unified Modeling Language(UML) gives yo the tools needed to diagram a project for quick
  reference and reporting

Introduction to UML:
- Unified Modeling Language: It is a diagram to represent a complete object
  oriented system which can be applicable across all OOPs Language.

1. Class Diagram
  - Name of the Class
  - Attributes
  - Methods

* Knowing more UML will not make a better Object Oriented Developer
* Knowing little UML is better than knowing lot more UML (because it might be like "tail wagging the dog")
