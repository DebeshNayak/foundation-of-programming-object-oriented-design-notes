Employing user stories:
Notes:
- Use cases delve into the details on a single process, but that is not the only
  way to understand how a user might want to use an application.
- Employing user stories allows you to quickly brainstorm dozens of different tasks
  a user might want to accomplish.
- This helps during programming, as it guides you as you make functionality and
  interface decisions.
--------------------
* Another format for writing parts of our application:
* What the user want to do and why they want to do it.
* Unlike use case which is several pages, it is written as only one or probably
  two sentences, and
* It is written on index card
* So it is short, sweet, and to the point

* User story:
As a ...(type of user)
I want ...(goal)
so that ...(reason)

Example - 1:
As a Bank Customer
I want to change my PIN online
so that I don't have to go into a branch

Example - 2:
As a User
I want to search by keyword
so that I can find and read relevant article

Example - 3:
As a User
I want to sort entries by date
so that I can find the most recent content

Example - 4:
As a Reader
I want to change the font and color scheme
so that I can read in different lighting

Example - 5:
As a User
I want to be prompted to save
so that I don't lose any work
-------------------------
User Stories:
- short - one index card
- one goal, no details
- informal
- "placeholder for conversation"
- Used in Scrum or Extreme Programming methodologies

Use Cases:
- long - a document
- multiple goals and details
- casual to (very) formal
- "record of conversation"
- Formal Software Development Methodologies
------------
* Whether we write use case or user stories, we typically writing down all the
  steps so that we can get all the necessary things that our next step that our
  application needs.
