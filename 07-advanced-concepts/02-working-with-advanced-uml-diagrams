Working with advanced UML diagrams:
Notes:
- State machine diagrams don't concentrate on the programming process but rather
  on a single object, with the aim being to track the way it changes state at various times.
- Meanwhile, an activity diagram is a form of flowchart that tracks the decisions
  and transitions in part of a system.
- One variant of the activity diagram splits different classes in a visual style
  commonly know as a swim lane.

UML Diagrams:
1. Class Diagram
2. Use Case Diagram
3. Object Diagram
4. Sequence Diagram
5. State Machine Diagram: change of state of object over time
6. Activity Diagram: closes thing to classic flow chat diagram, detail the steps
                      the transition and decision that occur as flow through different part of a system.
7. Deployment Diagram
8. Package Diagram
9. Component Diagram
10. Profile Diagram
11. Communication Diagram
12. Timing Diagram
13. Composite Structure Diagram
14. Interaction Overview Diagram
