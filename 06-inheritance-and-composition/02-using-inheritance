Using Inheritance:
Notes:
- Inheritance lets yo create a new class that is based on an existing class.
- Using inheritance can save you the trouble and time involved with starting from scratch.
-------
Example of Inheritance across multiple language:

Java    public class Album extends product { ...
C#      public class Album : Product { ...
VB.NET  public Class Album Inherits Product ...
Ruby    class Album < Product ...
C++     class Album : public Product { ...
Obj-C   @interface Album : Product { ...

----------------
* Overriding method in some language require to specify keyword.
----------------
Calling a method in the super / parent / base class:

Java    super.doSomething();
C#      base.doSomething();
VB.NET  MyBase.doSomething()
Ruby    super do_something
Obj-C   [super someMethod];
C++     NamedBaseClass::doSomething();
