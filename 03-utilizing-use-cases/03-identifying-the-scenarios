Identifying the Scenarios:
Notes:
- When programming, a broad use case can usually be broken down into smaller scenarios.
- A scenario is defined as a goal that an actor can accomplish with a single encounter.
- Identifying the scenario may be as simple as looking at potential outcomes.
- A user might:
  - buy a product,
  - check their balance
  - contact the company
  - or any other task
  can be accomplished with a single visit through multiple steps.

-----------------
- User login to a system is not a scenario, user log in to a system to do something, that something is a scenario.
* Identifying Scenarios:
  - Emphasize the goal of one encounter.

  Valid scenarios ex:
    - Purchase items
    - Create new document
    - Balance accounts

  - User focused goal having multiple encounter

  Invalid scenarios ex:
    - Log in to application
    - Write book
    - Merge organizations
--------------
Multiple Scenarios:(Sunny day use case)
Ex:
Title: Purchase items
Actor: Customer
Scenario:
  - Customer reviews items in shopping cart.
  - customer provides payment and shipping information.
  - System validates payment information and responds with confirmation of order
    and provides order number that Customer can use to check on order status.
  - System will send Customer a confirmation of order details and tracking number in an email.
Extension: One or more items out of stock.
  (a) Customer removes out-of-stock item and continues
  (b) Customer cancels entire order
  ...
Extension: Customer payment method rejected.
  (a) ...
----------------
* When writing scenario use "Active Voice" and omit needless words:
Example - 1:
  Not this: The system is provided with the payment information and shipping information by the Customer.
  This: Customer provides payment and shipping information.
Example - 2:
  Not this: The system connects to the external payment process over HTTP and
  uses JSON to submit the provided payment information to be validated, then waits
  for a delegated callback response.
  (This is looks like a pseudocode)
  This: System validates payment information.
----------------
Focus on Intention:
Ex:
  Title: Purchase items
  Actor: Customer

  Scenario:
    1. Customer chooses to enter the checkout process
    2. Customer is shown a confirmation page for their order, allowing
    them to change quantities, remove items, or cancel
    3. Customer enters his/her shipping address.
    4. System validates customer address
    5. Customer selects payment method
    6. System validates payment details
    7. System creates order number for tracking
    8. System displays confirmation screen to Customer
    9. Email is sent to Customer with order details
----------
* When we come up with a fist set of goal or actors, we have to check the answers of few questions
* This will prompt new goal scenarios or new actors
* Use case Prompts:
  1. Who performs system administration tasks?
  2. Who manages users and security?
  3. What happens if the system fails?
  4. Is anyone looking at performance metrics or logs?
---------
* Once we have use case written we have to look for a use case diagram to tie that together.
