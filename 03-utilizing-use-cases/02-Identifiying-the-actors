Identifying the actors:
Notes:
  - When defining a use case, you must first consider the potential actor.
  - An actor is the third-party that will interact with your program.
  - identifying the actors allow you to create scenarios surrounding specific use cases.
  - Learning how to identify the most common actors for your program can help you
    find potential problems before finishing development.

------------
Example:
Payroll Application:
Actors:
  1. Payroll Administrator
  2. Employee
  3. Manager
  4. ACMECorp Check Printing
  5. HR System
---------------
Identifying Actors:
  1. External Systems / organizations
    - External data sources, web services, other corporate apps, tax reporting, backup systems
  2. Roles / Security Groups
    - Visitor, member, administrator, owner
  3. Job Titles / Departments
    - Manager, Payroll Administrator, Production Staff, Executive Team, Accounting

  - If there are having multiple actors:
    Ex:
         Expense Approval System
    - Payroll Administrator, HR Staff, janitorial,
      Part-Time Staff, Executive Team, Production,
      Managers, Contractors, Marketing
    - Could be converted to: Requester, Approver
    - So in this case there are
        * Primary actors: who initiate the use case (Requester)
        * Supporting actors: Anyone else (Approver)
