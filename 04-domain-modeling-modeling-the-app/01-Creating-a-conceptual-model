Creating a conceptual model:
Notes:
- Once you have use cases and user stories, programming development moves on
  to a broader perspective.
- You need to get an idea of the most important functions of your application.
- Creating a conceptual model helps you see the most critical elements and how
  they interact with each other.
---------------
- After creating use case we need to create a conceptual model of our application.
- Conceptual Model means identifying most important object of the app.
- Object is used here loosely, i.e. what are the things in the application that
  we need to be aware of.
- We start to refine the objects
- Then draw them in simple diagram
- And we can show the association/interaction between them, which object which other object and how did they use them
- This step should not require more than 1 hour
