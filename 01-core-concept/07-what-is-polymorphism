Notes:
- When creating different classes and programming strings, learning how to apply
  the right string at the right time is crucial.
- Polymorphism help with exactly that issue.
- What is polymorphism? - it is the term for programming that automatically detects
  the right response to different actions.
--------------------------------------------
What is polymorphism?
- Many forms
- Automatically detect the correct behavior although we work on many different behavior.
- Example: + (plus sign)
  - Addition in case of integer
  - Concatenation in case of string
- Also this can be applied to our own classes and own objects
- Suppose we have BankAccount class with two behaviors deposit() and withdraw(), and then
  from this class we inherited 3 specialized version of sub-classes called CheckingAccount
  class, SavingsAccount class, InvestmentAccount class, and in InvestmentAccount class we
  want to modify the parent withdraw() then we can do thing by the concept call "Method Overriding".
- Here there are two version of same method for InvestmentAccount, so we can inherit withdraw() method
  of the same class when it is useful and overriding it from the parent class when that is useful.
- So polymorphism gives us flexibility while programming
- Understanding basic idea is enough for us where to use these APIE concepts.
