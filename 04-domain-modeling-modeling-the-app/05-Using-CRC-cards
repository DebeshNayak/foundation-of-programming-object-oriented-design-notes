Using CRC cards:
Notes:
- Different organizational methods reveal different things when programming.
- A conceptual design presents your application in one way, but using CRC cards
  offers a different way of interpreting the same data.
- Class, Responsibility, Collaboration cards allow you to quickly notate relevant
  information for each class and organize classes in a variety of ways.

CRC: Class, Responsibility, Collaborations

Size: 4" x 6" index card

Format:

Class name


Responsibility        +          Collaborators
                      |
....                  | .....
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      |
                      +

* Where
  - "Collaborators" are the associated classes
* We can arrange these card easily to figure out natural collaborator the way that the object interact
* Inforce constraint: If more than 1 card needed for a class then we have to redesign a class.

Example - 1:

Order
                           +
Process order              | Customer
Confirm order              | Item
Get order number           | Email
Get status                 | Address
Create confirmation email  | Payment
                           |
                           |
                           +
