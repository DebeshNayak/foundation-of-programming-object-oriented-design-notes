What is an Object?
- What is an object in real world.
- Identity, attribute and behavior describe an object

Objects are not always physical items.
Object are not always visible items

- Is that word a noun?
- Can we use "the" in-front of that word

Notes:
- Real-world objects have their own identities and properties.
- Objects in computer programming also do, but they go further.
  For example, a date or bank account can be an object in a computer program,
  while you can't touch one in real life.
